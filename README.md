# Image-Slider

1) HTML markups
2) All styles are done using pure CSS
3) DOM manipulation:
- Use querySelector to select all DOM elements requirement for DOM manipulations
- Loop thru each slide element using querySelectorAll.forEach(). If the currentSlide is present then its opacity will display to 1 and visibility to visible; while all other slide elements, its pacity will be zero and visibility hidden
- The controll button will allow one to play/stop the slides. Its innerText will toggle between play/stop status
- The two arrows left/right when clicked will clear the current interval and allow each image to be slide
- Add keydown event to window object space to pause/play slides, right/left arrow to manually slide each image
